# desi_blog

This is a simple blog web app. In order for registration function to work you need to enter your mail server details in settings.py file. Plan to put registration disabling functionality since this site is intended for solo / heavily administered blogging ( Besides, django already provides admin a functionality to add users ).  

The password reset functionality may have a replay attack ( if the link gets compromised , it cam be re used. I have not tested yet. )
